					text:`"In the secret cave of the heart, two are
					Seated by life's fountain. The separate ego 
					Drinks of the sweet and bitter stuff,
					Liking the sweet, disliking the bitter,
					While the supreme Self drinks sweet and bitter 
					Neither liking this nor disliking that.
					The ego gropes in darkness, while the 
					Self Lives in light. So declare the illumined sages, 
					And the householders who worship
					The sacred fire in the name of the Lord.


					May we light the fire of Nachiketa
					That burns out the ego, and enables us
					To pass from fearful fragmentation
					To fearless fullness in the changeless Whole.


					Know the Self as lord of the chariot,
					The body as the chariot itself,
					The discriminating intellect as
					The charioteer, and the mind as the reins. 
					The senses, say the wise, are the horses; 
					Selfish desires are the roads they travel. 
					When the Self is confused with the body, 
					Mind, and senses, they point out, he seems 
					To enjoy pleasure and suffer sorrow.


					When a person lacks discrimination
					And his mind is undisciplined, his senses 
					Run hither and thither like wild horses.
					But they obey the rein like trained horses 
					When a person has discrimination
					And the mind is one-pointed. Those who lack 
					Discrimination, with little control
					Over their thoughts and far from pure,
					Reach not the pure state of immortality
					But wander from death to death; while those 
					Who have discrimination, with a still mind 
					And a pure heart, reach journey's end,
					Never again to fall into the jaws of death. 
					With a discriminating intellect
					As charioteer, a well-trained mind as reins, 
					They attain the supreme goal of life
					To be united with the Lord of Love.
					The senses derive from objects of sense-perception, 
					Sense-objects from mind, mind from intellect,
					And intellect from ego; ego from undifferentiated 
					Consciousness, and consciousness from Brahman. 
					Brahman is the first Cause and last refuge. 
					Brahman, the hidden Self in everyone,
					Does not shine forth. He is revealed only
					To those who keep their minds one-pointed
					On the Lord of Love and thus develop
					A superconscious manner of knowing. 
					Meditation empowers them to go
					Deeper and deeper into consciousness,
					From the world of words to the world of thought, 
					Then beyond thoughts to wisdom in the Self.


					Get up! Wake up! Seek the guidance of an 
					Illumined teacher and realize the Self. 
					Sharp like a razor's edge is the path,
					The sages say, difficult to traverse.


					The supreme Self is beyond name and form, 
					Beyond the senses, inexhaustible,
					Without beginning, without end,
					Beyond time, space, and causality, eternal, 
					Immutable. Those who realize the Self
					Are forever free from the jaws of death.

					The wise, who gain experiential knowledge 
					Of this timeless tale of Nachiketa
					Narrated by Death, attain the glory
					Of living in spiritual awareness.
					Those who, full of devotion, recite this 
					Supreme mystery at a spiritual 
					Gathering, are fit for eternal life.
					They are indeed fit for eternal life."`

text: `In the city of Brahman is a secret dwelling, the lotus of the heart. Within this dwelling is a space, and within that space is the fulfillment of our desires. What is within that space should be longed for and realized.

As great as the infinite space beyond is the space within the lotus of the heart. Both heaven and earth are contained in that inner space, both fire and air, sun and moon, lightning and stars. Whether we know it in this world or know it not, everything is contained in that inner space.

Never fear that old age will invade that city; never fear that this inner treasure of all reality will wither and decay. This knows no age when the body ages; this knows no dying when the body dies. This is the real city of Brahman; this is the Self, free from old age, from death and grief, hunger and thirst. In the Self all desires are fulfilled.

The Self desires only what is real, thinks nothing but what is true. Here people do what they are told, becoming dependent on their country, or their piece of land, or the desires of another, so their desires are not fulfilled and their works come to nothing, both in this world and in the next. Those who depart from this world without knowing who they are or what they truly desire have no freedom here or hereafter.

But those who leave here knowing who they are and what they truly desire have freedom everywhere, both in this world and in the next.

Like strangers in an unfamiliar country walking over a hidden treasure, day by day we enter the world of Brahman while in deep sleep but never find it, carried away by what is false.

The Self is hidden in the lotus of the heart. Those who see themselves in all creatures go day by day into the world of Brahman hidden in the heart. Established in peace, they rise above body-consciousness to the supreme light of the Self. Immortal, free from fear, this Self is Brahman, called the True. Beyond the mortal and the immortal, he binds both worlds together. Those who know this live day after day in heaven in this very life.

The Self is a bulwark against the confounding of these worlds and a bridge between them. Day and night cannot cross that bridge, nor old age, nor death, nor grief, nor evil or good deeds. All evils turn back there, unable to cross; evil comes not into this world of Brahman.

One who crosses by this bridge, therefore, if blind, is blind no more; if hurt, ceases to be hurt; if in sorrow, ceases sorrowing. At this boundary night itself becomes day: night comes not into this world of Brahman.

Only those who are pure and self-controlled can find this world of Brahman. That world is theirs alone. In that world, in all the worlds, they live in perfect freedom.`
