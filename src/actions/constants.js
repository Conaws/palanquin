					text:`"In the secret cave of the heart, two are
					Seated by life's fountain. The separate ego 
					Drinks of the sweet and bitter stuff,
					Liking the sweet, disliking the bitter,
					While the supreme Self drinks sweet and bitter 
					Neither liking this nor disliking that.
					The ego gropes in darkness, while the 
					Self Lives in light. So declare the illumined sages, 
					And the householders who worship
					The sacred fire in the name of the Lord.


					May we light the fire of Nachiketa
					That burns out the ego, and enables us
					To pass from fearful fragmentation
					To fearless fullness in the changeless Whole.


					Know the Self as lord of the chariot,
					The body as the chariot itself,
					The discriminating intellect as
					The charioteer, and the mind as the reins. 
					The senses, say the wise, are the horses; 
					Selfish desires are the roads they travel. 
					When the Self is confused with the body, 
					Mind, and senses, they point out, he seems 
					To enjoy pleasure and suffer sorrow.


					When a person lacks discrimination
					And his mind is undisciplined, his senses 
					Run hither and thither like wild horses.
					But they obey the rein like trained horses 
					When a person has discrimination
					And the mind is one-pointed. Those who lack 
					Discrimination, with little control
					Over their thoughts and far from pure,
					Reach not the pure state of immortality
					But wander from death to death; while those 
					Who have discrimination, with a still mind 
					And a pure heart, reach journey's end,
					Never again to fall into the jaws of death. 
					With a discriminating intellect
					As charioteer, a well-trained mind as reins, 
					They attain the supreme goal of life
					To be united with the Lord of Love.
					The senses derive from objects of sense-perception, 
					Sense-objects from mind, mind from intellect,
					And intellect from ego; ego from undifferentiated 
					Consciousness, and consciousness from Brahman. 
					Brahman is the first Cause and last refuge. 
					Brahman, the hidden Self in everyone,
					Does not shine forth. He is revealed only
					To those who keep their minds one-pointed
					On the Lord of Love and thus develop
					A superconscious manner of knowing. 
					Meditation empowers them to go
					Deeper and deeper into consciousness,
					From the world of words to the world of thought, 
					Then beyond thoughts to wisdom in the Self.


					Get up! Wake up! Seek the guidance of an 
					Illumined teacher and realize the Self. 
					Sharp like a razor's edge is the path,
					The sages say, difficult to traverse.


					The supreme Self is beyond name and form, 
					Beyond the senses, inexhaustible,
					Without beginning, without end,
					Beyond time, space, and causality, eternal, 
					Immutable. Those who realize the Self
					Are forever free from the jaws of death.

					The wise, who gain experiential knowledge 
					Of this timeless tale of Nachiketa
					Narrated by Death, attain the glory
					Of living in spiritual awareness.
					Those who, full of devotion, recite this 
					Supreme mystery at a spiritual 
					Gathering, are fit for eternal life.
					They are indeed fit for eternal life."`
